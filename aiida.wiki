'''AiiDA''' ('''A'''utomated '''I'''nteractive '''I'''nfrastructure and '''DA'''tabase for Computational Science) is an [[Open-source_software|open-source]] [[Python_(programming_language)|Python]] software package designed to help researchers manage, preserve, and share computational scientific workflows in materials science, condensed matter physics, and computational chemistry.

== Overview ==
AiiDA is a comprehensive workflow management system that automates the complexity of computational research by providing tools for data provenance, workflow automation, and integration with high-performance computing (HPC) resources.
